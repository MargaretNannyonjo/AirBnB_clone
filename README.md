Description
The AirBnB Clone Project aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. It involves building a command-line interface to manage AirBnB objects such as users, listings, locations, etc., as well as implementing storage mechanisms and unit tests.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a crucial component of the AirBnB Clone Project. It allows users to interact with the system, perform various operations on AirBnB objects, and manage the application's functionalities.

How to Start
To start the command interpreter:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command interpreter script.

How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to manage AirBnB objects. Available commands include creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving objects. Use the help command to display a list of available commands and their descriptions.

Here are some examples of commands you can use with the command interpreter:
Create a new user:
create_user John Doe

Delete a user:
delete_user John Doe

Update a user:
update_user John Doe

Create a Place listing:
create_place NewYorkApartment
